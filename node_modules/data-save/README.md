data-save
===============

## Key-Value Storage of true data types for node

data-save is an API to store Key-Value pairs as true data types. It uses a file at the root of the project.

It handles JSON objects, arrays, booleans, numbers, and even returns undefined and null accurately.

```
npm install data-save
```

data-save is based heavily on the excellent [Vault.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vault.js) by the preeminent [Jimmy Byrum](https://www.npmjs.com/~jimmybyrum)

### Usage

```
var ds = require('data-save');

ds.set(<key>, <value>, [config], [file]);
ds.get(<key>, [file]);
ds.remove(<key>, [file]);
ds.clear([file]);
ds.list([file]);
```

If no file is supplied, the default file will be used
